# 🐧 LPI Linux Essentials – Study/Labbing

Welcome to my **LPI Linux Essentials Study Repository**.  
This repo holds all my notes, summaries, and lab references for every exam objective.  
I keep everything short, exam-ready, and focused on the core skills I need to pass.

**My study advice (to myself):**
- Repeat the basics until they feel automatic.
- Don’t try to memorize everything—focus on workflows.
- Use labs to reinforce commands, not to overcomplicate them.
- Stay consistent and keep the notes tight and clean.
